Welcome to Team Climate Change CO2 Emissions Data Program! 
Youtube link to demonstration for easier understanding: https://youtu.be/PxLZRm9D34A?si=yz_DoTnvwuh32ZbT 
In the main.cpp, you will see an unordered map, but it is only implemented to match the states abbreviations to the actual names. I will explain more in the video but I did want to ensure that it was not used for any other part of the project. 
email me at grace.toner@ufl.edu if you have any questions or concerns.
